			<h3>Oct. 26</h3> <br>
<strong>Class 18, Monday</strong><br><br>
<br>
• Let's review a couple examples from the mid-term and chat about any next steps.<br><br>
• First, finish your portrait coded in HTML and CSS.<br>
• Next, on a piece of paper, draw out or note each animation you would like to implement.<br>
• Remember that the animation should loop infinitely. Your animation can be very subtle (think hair blowing in the wind, eyes moving slightly), or if you prefer, more dramatic. <br>
• Reference the Resources section of the site for animation techniques. <br>
• Implement each animation one by one. Remember that once you get one working, you can copy and paste the code. Be wary of spelling mistakes or not closing brackets. <br>
• Once your animation works well and you are satisfied with the result, upload it to Github and link to it on your home page. <br>
<br>
Reference Files:<br>
• A few ideas for the facial animation can be found online. Below are two references, but feel free to get creative, or to do your own research:
• <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/30132857/99-Animated-Emojis-for-Closer-Motion" target="_blank">Behance Emoji Example</a> <br>
<br>
Coding References:<br>
• <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14446677/how-to-make-3-corner-rounded-triangle-in-css" target="_blank">Rounded corner triangle </a><br>
• <a href="https://mjanic3.github.io/DES350/portrait.html" target="_blank">The example I showed in class</a> – you can view the source to see the animation.<br>
<br>
<br>
For Wednesday:<br>
• Upload your progress to GitHub. <br>
• Be ready to explain how the avatar you created resembles your subject, and why the motion you chose to implement adds to the representation. <br>

			<h3>Oct. 21</h3> <br>
<strong>Class 17, Wednesday – Mid Term!</strong><br><br>
<strong>Create and upload a new design for your home page using CSS.</strong><br>
<br>
Keep in mind the following considerations:<br>
1. Remove all moodboards, and any pages with images gathered from the web. <br>
2. Use at least one roll-over transition.<br>
3. To review transitions, reference this resource: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp</a><br>
4. Organize your projects by grouping links in a way that makes sense.<br>
5. Make sure your project links are visible above the fold, so without any scrolling on the page.<br>
6. Below your projects, create an About Me section. This is open to your interpretation and can contain text or shapes.<br>
7. Do not use any jpgs on the home page. You can use text, shapes, and colors.<br>
8. Infuse your personal style to your home page, but keep it legible and accessible.<br>
9. <strong>Upload your design to GitHub before 6.40pm.</strong> It should be the "index.html" file on your GitHub account.<br>
10. You are free to leave the class zoom after you complete and upload your page.<br>
